# R-programming

some programs in r

The " Connect Four-minimax.R" is game program. 
I use minimax algorithm in this program, so that the computer player can make a choice, instead of choosing randomly.
By increasing the "depth", the computer player may find a better choice, but it may also take longer time in process.

The "lasso_relative_methods.R" is the code that I used in my undergraduate thesis. 
In the code, I established a linear model based on lasso, adaptive-lasso, SCAD, elastic net, group lasso and group SCAD with real data.

The "web scrapping.Rmd" is a simple wep scrapping program.

The "Robust" is a R package. It is a practice of making a r package.

The "stat601_project" is a small project that we use some methods to analyze medical clinic data.
